# Local environment using remote backend

Ordinarily, you'll run a local copy of terraware-server, perhaps using the `docker-compose.yml`
in the parent directory, and the Node server that's launched by `yarn start` will forward API
requests to that server.

However, sometimes it's useful to run a local frontend dev environment but send API requests to
a remote backend, e.g., if you want to test how a UI change works with a real-world data set.
Here's how to set that up using Docker Desktop on MacOS.

1. Generate a self-signed certificate. The following command should work. You'll only need
   to do this once.

```shell
openssl req \
--x509 \
--nodes \
--days 3650 \
--subj "/C=US/ST=HI/O=Terraformation/CN=localhost" \
--addext "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost" \
--newkey rsa:2048 \
--keyout self-signed.key \
--out self-signed.crt
```

2. Figure out the server URL you want to use, e.g., `https://terraware.io` for production.
3. Set `REACT_APP_TERRAWARE_API` to that URL in the `.env` file in the repo root directory.
4. Start (or restart) the Node dev server, e.g., by running `yarn start:dev` in the repo
   root directory.
5. In this directory, run `docker-compose up -d`.
6. Point your browser at `https://localhost/` (HTTPS and no port number).
7. Accept the self-signed certificate. In Chrome, you'd click the "Advanced" button on the
   warning message, then click the "Proceed" link. You should only need to do this once;
   the browser will remember the certificate.

Now you should be able to log in and use the web app.

When you're done, you can run `docker-compose down` in this directory to shut down the HTTPS
proxy.

You don't need to run the HTTPS proxy if you're testing with a local terraware-server instance;
in that case you can point your browser at Node's HTTP listen port (`http://localhost:3000`).
