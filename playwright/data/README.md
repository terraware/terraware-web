# Overview

This directory contains csv files that can be used to upload variables, modules, and deliverables to the local app in
order to generate a postgres dump file for use with the tests.

The CSV files should be updated when new variables, modules, or deliverables are needed for testing. Be sure to check
with the accelerator team to make sure confidential information is not included.
